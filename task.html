    <h1>Suryakumar Yadav says India vs Pakistan no longer rivalry, quotes ’13-0, 10-1′ statistics</h1>
     <p>India vs Pakistan, Asia Cup 2025: Suryakumar Yadav's assessment was not as inflammatory as those he had uttered last Sunday, when he dedicated the victory to the victims of the 
        Pahalgam terror strikes, the families and jawans of the Operation Sindoor</p>

<p>The question to Suryakumar from a Pakistani journalist was straightforward: “Did you feel that Pakistan has competed in a better way today?” But he went on a different tangent, and said: “I would like to say something on this question.” He continued: “I feel that you should stop asking questions on rivalry. Because (talking of rivalry), I didn’t get the standard of rivalry. 
    Standard rivalry is the same thing, whether a team plays good cricket or not,” he said.</p>

        The question had not even mentioned the word rivalry. Then he explained his concept of rivalry: “According to me, if two teams have to play 15-20 matches, and if there’s a 7-all or someone is ahead 8-7, then it’s called playing good cricket and it’s called rivalry. 13-0, 10-1, I don’t know what the stats are. But this is not a rivalry anymore.,” he said. Surya did not answer the question, but made the point he wanted to make.
